CircleTree
==========
Everybody loves circular dendrograms. They give you more space in the margin to fill with annotations and flirts with the awesome [Circos](http://circos.ca) plots. Here's my go at it in R.

For more information please visit the [project website](http://backlin.github.io/polarClust/).

This package is essentially just provide a fancy way to visualizate `hclust` objects. If you want something bigger and more phylogenetically sophisticated you probably want the [ape package](http://ape-package.ird.fr/).
